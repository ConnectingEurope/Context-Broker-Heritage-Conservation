![Architecture](../img/Architecture_Heritage_Conservation.png)

> *Illustration 1. Architecture of the Context Broker Heritage Conservation*

It is recommended to read the links of the [Reference documentation](../../README.md#reference-documentation) section before continuing reading the rest of this documentation.

Hereunder, the most relevant set of tools of the architecture are going to be detailed:

#### Context Broker 

The Context Broker is responsible of providing real-time data to all de components. The most recent information is stored in the Elasticsearch using Apache Nifi. Context Broker uses the LD version.

More information of the Context Broker LD can be found [here](https://github.com/FIWARE/context.Orion-LD).

[Top](#technical-documentation)

#### Apache Nifi

Apache Nifi stores all the data that the Context Broker provides in Elasticsearch. Nifi transforms the data coming from Context Broker so that it can be ingested into Elasticsearch respecting NGSI LD.

More information of Apache Nifi can be found [here](https://nifi.apache.org/).

[Top](#technical-documentation)

#### CB Context Broker Heritage Conservation LD Backend

The Back-end of the Context Broker Data Visualisation Context Broker Heritage Conservation is a NodeJS module that acts as the server of the Front-end of the Data Visualisation. It is adapted to accept the NGSI LD format.

It is responsible of sending all the requests to the Context Broker, managing all the data of the Data Visualisation Context Broker Heritage Conservation.

It also stores the configuration of the Configuration page in an internal JSON file called configuration.

[Top](#technical-documentation)

#### CB Context Broker Heritage Conservation LD Frontend

The Front-end of the Data Visualisation Context Broker Heritage Conservation consists on the visualization layer. It contains all the views of the Context Broker Heritage Conservation (map, configuration, historical data, etc.) and requests all the information to be displayed directly to the Backend. It is adapted to accept the NGSI LD format.

[Top](#technical-documentation)

#### Kibana

Kibana is the tool used to visualize historical data and generate added value to all the data using its Business Intelligence engine.

More information of Kibana can be found [here](https://www.elastic.co/es/kibana).

[Top](#technical-documentation)

#### API

The API includes the rule engine. It's based on [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/), a Python framework for web development. In addition, it also includes some methods for user management and obtaining external data.

[Top](#technical-documentation)

#### MQTT connector

The MQTT connector is used to get the data from the LoRa platform. This component is developed in Python. This connector is compatible with the following devices:

- Ambient sensor: **AM107** (Milesight IoT)

### Understanding the code

The objective of this section is to explain different technical aspects of the Context Broker Heritage Conservation, including new developments, modifying parts of the Context Broker Fire Prevention, etc.

[Top](#technical-documentation)

#### How to change the refresh time of the information

By default, the refresh time of the real-time data in the map is 1 minute. In milliseconds, it is 60000.

This refresh time can be changed, modifying a the value of a variable in the map-dashboard.component.ts.

```typescript
    private intervalRefreshMilliseconds: number = 60000;
```

In this case, the value of the *intervalRefreshMilliseconds* variable (60000) can be replaced by the desired refresh time (in milliseconds).

[Top](#technical-documentation)

### How to change historical data dashboards

The dashboards of the Context Broker Heritage Conservation are generated using [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/es/kibana).

The following steps explain how to change the current kibana dashboards to another dashboard.
 1. Open the **historical-dashboard.component.ts** and **historical-dashboard.component.html** files.
 2. In the **historical-dashboard.component.ts**, there are the different links to each dashboard which will be replaced with the desired URL dashboard and a variable used to switch between dashboards:

```typescript
public firstDashboard: any ="http://link-to-first-dashboard.com";
public secondDashboard: any ="http://link-to-second-dashboard.com";
public dashboardRef: any;
```

 3. The name of the variable should be replaced as well with a descripting name.
 4. It needs a sanitizer to enable the URL as a secure source and a default dashboard to be displayed:
 
 ```typescript
    constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer){
    this.dashboardRef = this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(this.firstDashboard);
    }
 ```

 5. Once all the different links has been changed, we will need to change the switch that acts as a orchestrator to get the proper dashboard link:
 
 ```typescrypt
 public changeDashboard(dashboard: string): void{
  swtich(dashboard){
    case 'first':
      this.dashboardRef = this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(this.firstDashboard);
      break;
    case 'second':
      this.dashboardRef = this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(this.secondDashboard);
      break;
  }
 }
 ```

 6. In the **historical-dashboard.component.html**, add the needed buttons by copying the existing one and change the name and the string passed to the function:
 
 ```html
<button class="btn text-white mx-1 col-12 col-auto float-right" (click)="changeDashboard('first')">First dashboard</button>
<button class="btn text-white mx-1 col-12 col-auto float-right" (click)="changeDashboard('second')">Second dashboard</button>
```

7. The new dashboards will be displayed if the links are properly set.

### How to change notifications dashboard

The dashboards of the Context Broker Heritage Conservation are generated using [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/es/kibana).

The following steps explain how to change the current notifications dashboard:
1. Open the **notifications.component.ts** file.
2. In the **notifications.component.ts**, there is a notifications link to the dashboard:

```typescript
public notifications: any ="http://link-to-notifications-dashboard.com";
public dashboardRef: any;
```

3. As in the previous [How to point](#how-to-change-historical-data-dashboards), it needs a sanitiizer to enable the URL as a secure source and a default dashboard to be displayed:

```typescript
    constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer){
    this.dashboardRef = this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(this.notifications);
    }
 ```

4. The new notifications dashboard will be changed and it will be shown if the dashboard is compatible with the html iframe tag.

[Top](#technical-documentation)

### How to change polygon colors

If the entity has a polygon object in the location attribute, is possible to change the fill and the stroke color depending on a specific value. 

The following steps explain how to change the colors and the attribute:
1.  Open the **map-dashboard.component.ts** file.
2.  In the variables declaration part, there is an colors object with the name and the hexadecimal code of each color we want: 

```typescript
private colors: any = {low:"#28a746", moderate:"#5894f4",high:"#ffc107",very_high:"#ec7628",extreme:"#dc3546"}
```

3.  Once the colors have been set, the next step is to change the ranges at **getColor** function, placed at **map-dashboard.component.ts** file:

```typescript
    private getColor(index: number): string{
            var color: string;
            if(index < 5){
                color = this.colors.low;
            }else if(index >= 5 && index < 14){
                color = this.colors.moderate;
            }else if(index >= 14 && index < 21){
                color = this.colors.high;
            }else if(index >= 21 && index < 33){
                color = this.colors.very_high;
            }else if(index >= 33){
                color = this.colors.extreme;
            }

            return color;
        }
```

4.  In the **setGeoJSONattributes** function, the desired attribute to define de color can be changed:

```typescript
color = this.getColor(entity.fireWeatherIndex);
```
```typescript
    private setGeoJSONattributes(model: ModelDto, entity: Entity): string{
            var color: string;
            color = this.getColor(entity.fireWeatherIndex);
            const geoJSON = '{   "fillColor": "'+ color +'",' +
                                '"weight": 2,'+
                                '"opacity": 1,' +
                                '"color": "'+ color +'",' +  //Outline color
                                '"fillOpacity": 0.7' +
                            '}';
            return geoJSON;
        }
```

5.  For the previous step, make sure to have the attribute name declared in the **Entity** interface. Open the **entity.ts** file and add the proper attribute:

```typescript
export interface Entity{
  id?: string;
  type?: string;
  location?:any;
  fireWeatherIndex?:number;
}
```

#### How the information of the map is updated

In order to optimize the load and update of the information of the map, it is updated based on the following actions:

- For the first load of information (after completing the configuration on the Configuration page), all the sensors are situated on the map. Additionally, the loaded attributes are:
  - ID
  - Type
  - Location
  - Main attribute. More information can be found [here](../user/index.md#configuring-main-attributes).

- Once the initial load of information is completed, the previous attributes are updated every 60 seconds by default. This action allows to visualize sensors whose location is changing during the time (i.e. buses).

- The rest of attributes are updated when the user clicks on a sensor, showing the visualization panel.

- Additionally, when a filter is added, the values for the selected attributes as filters are also automatically updated every 60 seconds by default.

The previous procedure optimizes the load of information and allows to manage high amounts of information in the Context Broker Heritage Conservation, avoiding efficiency problems.

[Top](#technical-documentation)

#### Supported types of locations

The supported types of locations of the sensors are [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/).

This is an example:

```json
"location": {
    "type": "geo:json",
    "value": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [-3.712247222222222, 40.423852777777775]
    }
},
```

The **location** attribute of the sensors has to follow the previous schema. The type of the coordinates has to be **Point** or **Polygon**, and its value has to be a **list of two coordinates**. Otherwise, the sensors won't be supported in the Context Broker Heritage Conservation (i.e. LineString).

[Top](#technical-documentation)

#### Supported types of subscriptions

With the objective of generating historical data, Apache Nifi is subscribed to the Context Broker. Then, when the Context Broker receives new data and, if this data matches with the configuration of the subscription, it is sent to Apache Nifi (and stored in Elasticsearch).

There are some examples for subscriptions in this [link](https://www.postman.com/fiware/workspace/fiware-foundation-ev-s-public-workspace/collection/513743-41c2de83-48e2-46bb-9073-2a9fbe4fc5c3?ctx=documentation).

In relation with the subscriptions, there are lots of possibilities to configure them. Depending on the IDs of the entities, their attributes, the conditions for the notification, etc.

For the Context Broker Fire Prevention, the **supported subscriptions** is:

##### Subscriptions for a specific ID with multiple attributes

This type of subscription is focused on the entity whose ID is the same as the one indicated in the request. Concretely, in the **id** key.

All the desired attributes to be subscribed for the specific entity, need to be included in the **notification -> attrs list**.

This is the structure of the request for this kind of subscription:

**URL:** <http://your_ip:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/subscriptions/>

```json
{
  "description": "Notify Elasticsearch the changes of the attributes for the entity ENTITY_ID_1",
  "subject": {
    "entities": [
      {
        "id": "ENTITY_ID_1",
        "type": "TYPE_OF_THE_ENTITY"
      }
    ],
    "condition": {
      "attrs": []
    }
  },
  "notification": {
    "http": {
      "url": "http://example.com/notify"
    },
    "attrs": [
      "ATTRIBUTE_1",
      "ATTRIBUTE_2",
      "ATTRIBUTE_N"
    ]
  }
}
```
