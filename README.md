The **Context Broker Heritage Conservation** is a **project** made up of different components that help public organisations monitor the state of their historical heritage, detect anomalies and take preventive actions using Context Broker as the main core. It provides the following features:

- **Real-time data** visualisation through geo-localised sensors on a map, based on the information from the **Orion LD Context Broker**.

- **Historical data** visualisation for the sensors in table and graph formats, taking advantage of historical data tools like **Kibana**.

- Easy **Configuration page** for the integration with the Context Broker.

- **Rule engine** component to configure rules and thresholds to generate alerts.

- **Analytical algorithms** to calculate the most used indexes in Heritage Conservation.

- Deployment in **local environments**, **cloud environments** or **FIWARE lab** (Sandbox).

For more information, read the [Objective](#objective) section.

For the visualisation layer, the [Context Broker Data Visualisation Enabler](https://github.com/ConnectingEurope/Context-Broker-Data-Visualisation) has been reused, which has been adapted to be compatible with NGSI-LD. The Context Broker Data Visualisation is a [FIWARE](https://fiware.org) Generic Enabler.

You can find more info at the [FIWARE developers](https://developers.fiware.org/) website and the [FIWARE](https://fiware.org/) website.

The complete list of FIWARE GEs and Incubated FIWARE GEs can be found at the [FIWARE Catalogue](https://www.fiware.org/developers/catalogue/).

## Objective

The Context Broker Heritage Conservation was created with the aim of:

- Facilitating the **adoption** of the Context Broker.

- Helping cities and regions to detect anomalies on historical buildings and take preventive actions.

- Creating a solution that could be **reused in smart city and smart region projects**.

It could also be adapted to the needs of different users by developing its own features, taking advantage of the base of the solution. More information can be found in the [documentation](#documentation) section.
