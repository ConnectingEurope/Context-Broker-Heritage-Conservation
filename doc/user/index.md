### Initial configuration assistant

When the user accesses the Context Broker Heritage Conservation for the first time, the first step is to configure a Context Broker instance in order for data to start flowing. Hence, an information panel will appear giving the user the option to begin this configuration through the **Configuration page**.

![ConfigurationAssistant](../img/ConfigurationAssistant.png)
> *Illustration 4. Initial configuration pop-up*

[Top](#user-manual)

## Configuration

With the purpose of facilitating the integration of one or multiple Context Broker instances and historical data tools, the Context Broker Heritage Conservation provides a visual and intuitive configuration panel. The user will be able to use this panel to configure the information that is desired to be visualized.

This Configuration page is divided into different sections, for the configuration of the Context Broker (including its services) or the historical data tools.

The tools to be used have been configured following the [tutorials for deployment](../tutorials/index.md#tutorials-for-deployment) of the Context Broker Heritage Conservation.

[Top](#user-manual)

### Configuring Context Broker

The **Add Context Broker** button should be pressed to starting configuring a new Context Broker instance.

The user should introduce the desired name for that particular Context Broker instance and the URL where the data is available. Note that there may be a need to indicate the Context Broker’s port if the instance is serving in a specific one. For instance, if it is configured in a local environment and the port number is 1026, the URL should be *localhost:1026*.

Before proceeding, it is recommended to check the status of the Context Broker instance to ensure that the configuration provided is valid and ready to be used. This can be done by pressing the yellow checkbox next to the URL.

![Configuration Page](../img/ConfigurationPage.png)
>*Illustration 5. Configuration Panel*

![ContextBrokerFields](../img/ContextBrokerFields.png)
>*Illustration 6. Adding a new Context Broker*

If the URL introduced for the Context Broker is incorrect, the user will be informed with an unsuccesful connection message under the URL input.

![ContextBrokerIncorrectURL](../img/ContextBrokerIncorrectURL.png)
>*Illustration 7. Incorrect Context Broker URL.*

After the initial configuration of the Context Broker instance is done, the user must choose the desired entities and attributes to be displayed in the Context Broker Heritage Conservation by pressing the **Choose entities and attributes** button.

![ContextBrokerCorrectURL](../img/ContextBrokerCorrectURL.png)
>*Illustration 8. Successful Context Broker connection.*

![ContextBrokerEntities](../img/ContextBrokerEntities.png)
>*Illustration 9. Selecting the entities and attributes.*

The entities and attributes can be selected and unselected by pressing the checkbox or the name of the desired option. **At least one entity must be selected**, otherwise an error message will appear.

If various Context Broker instances are configured, they will appear as a group of tabs where each one can be displayed for its edition. In order to delete a Context Broker instance, the bin icon must be pressed. A confirmation message will appear asking the user to confirm the action.

[Top](#user-manual)

#### Services

The information of a Context Broker instance can be organized and divided in what is called **Services**. By using these services, the information can be encapsulated in different logical groups and their access has to be granted.

The aim of the services, which are optional, is to increase the security of the Context Broker's data. A user may have access to one service but not to the rest. Therefore, the user has the option of adding a service if necessary.

More information of services can be found [here](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/service_path/index.html).

If the user has access to one or several services, they can be added, edited and eliminated in the Context Broker Heritage Conservation. In order to add a new service to a Context Broker instance, the **The context Broker uses services** checkbox must be selected. A new panel with the **Services configuration** will be opened where the user will be able to start configuring them.

![ContextBrokerAddingServices](../img/ContextBrokerAddingServices.png)
>*Illustration 12. Configuring services.*

The user will be able to create services by pressing the **Add service** button.

![ContextBrokerNewService](../img/ContextBrokerNewService.png)
>*Illustration 13. Adding services.*

The user will need to configure the name of the service and, if needed, the service path. More information about the [Heritage Conservation Services](../technical/index.md#services). To check its availability, the **Choose entities and attributes** button should be pressed. If the configuration is incorrect, the user will be informed with an entities not found message under the button.

>*Illustration 14. Incorrect service name.*

![ContextBrokerServiceIncorrectPath](../img/ContextBrokerServiceIncorrectPath.png)
>*Illustration 15. Incorrect service path.*

If the configuration is correct, a **list of the available entities and attributes** will appear, where the user will be able to **select or unselect the desired ones**. **At least one entity must be selected**, otherwise an error message will appear.

![ContextBrokerServiceEntities](../img/ContextBrokerServiceEntities.png)
>*Illustration 16. Correct service name and path.*

![MessageIncorrectConfiguration](../img/MessageIncorrectConfiguration.png)
>*Illustration 17. Error message for no entities selected.*

If various services are configured, they will appear as a group of tabs where each one can be displayed for its edition. In order to delete a service, the garbage icon must be pressed. A confirmation message will appear asking the user to confirm the action.

#### Configuring main attributes

Once the entities and the attributes of the Context Broker instance (or one of its services) have been selected, the user will be able to select one single main attribute of the entity by pressing the **star icon**. This **main attribute** represents the data that will be **statically displayed** on the map next to the geo-localized sensor.

The user will **only be allowed to select one main attribute per each category**.

![MainAttributesInConfiguration](../img/ServicesMainAttributes.PNG)
>*Illustration 20. Configuring main attributes*

This information will be explained in the [Main attributes section](#main-attributes) of this document.

[Top](#user-manual)

### Saving the configuration

Once the user has finished configuring the Context Broker instance, its services and tools, the **Apply Configuration** button at the top of the page must be pressed to save the overall configurations. **Otherwise, the current configuration will not be effective**.

## Dashboard

### Map

The map that supports the Context Broker Heritage Conservation is the open source World map [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

The Context Broker Heritage Conservation supports the use of various Context Broker instances, therefore, all of the information contained in the configured Context Broker instances is shown on the map with the real-time data they provide.

Regarding the representation of the sensors, all of them must have coordinates for their geo-location and, taking advantage of those coordinates, they can be displayed directly over the map.

When zooming out of the map, the icons will start to cluster together in a single notification, showing the number of sensors available in the area. As the user zooms in, the sensors will start to separate and appear in the exact locations.

![MapSensors](../img/MapSensors.png)
>*Illustration 22. The Context Broker Heritage Conservation Map.*

[Top](#user-manual)

#### Main attributes

The user is be able to select one single main attribute for each entity from the Configuration page. If an important attribute has been configured, the visualisation of the map will include the visualisation of the selected main attribute.

The user will also be able to visualize on a side panel the list of main attributes selected for each type of sensor.

![MapWithMainAttributes](../img/MapSensorsWithMainAttributes.PNG)
>*Illustration 23. Main attributes over the sensors*

The Context Broker Heritage Conservation will also give the user the possibility to **enable or disable the display of the main attributes** and the side panel through a switch option.
